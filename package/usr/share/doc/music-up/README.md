  - Each track: `TrackNumber - TrackTitle`

### üóÇÔ∏è **XML Format**
Structured format for data exchange:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<albums>
  <album>
    <id>unique_album_id</id>
    <name>Album Name</name>
    <artist>Artist Name</artist>
    <genre>Rock</genre>
    <year>2024</year>
    <medium>Vinyl</medium>

      </track>
    </tracks>
  </album>
</albums>
```

### üìÅ **Folder Import Requirements**
For automatic folder-based import:

```
üìÅ Album Folder Name/
  üéµ 01 - Track Title.mp3
  üéµ 02 - Another Track.mp3  
  üéµ 03 - Third Track.mp3
```

**Requirements:**
- **Folder Name** = Album name
- **File Format:** `##` - `Track Title.mp3`
- **Track Numbers:** Two digits (01, 02, 03...)
- **Separator:** Space-dash-space (` - `)

### üí° **Import Tips**
- **JSON** provides complete data preservation with best track information support
- **CSV** supports both basic album info and track listings (using pipe `|` separator)
- **XML** works well for integration with other music management tools  
- **Folder Import** automatically extracts track listings from organized music files
- All formats support automatic duplicate detection during import
- **Track Format**: Always use `TrackNumber - TrackTitle` pattern (e.g., `01 - Song Name`)
- **CSV Tracks**: Use pipe character `|` to separate multiple tracks in one cell

## Testing

**MusicUp** features comprehensive test coverage across multiple layers to ensure reliability and maintainability.

### Test Coverage

Our test suite includes:
- **Service Layer Tests:** Critical business logic including wantlist sync, Discogs integration, and data persistence
- **Widget Tests:** UI component testing for forms, album lists, and user interactions
- **Integration Tests:** Complete user flows from adding albums to editing and deleting
- **Error Handling Tests:** Comprehensive testing of edge cases and error scenarios

### Running Tests

Execute all tests using Flutter's built-in testing framework:

```bash
flutter test
```

To run specific test categories:

```bash
# Run service layer tests
flutter test test/*_service_test.dart

# Run widget tests
flutter test test/*_widget_test.dart

# Run integration tests
flutter test test/integration_test.dart
```

### Test Structure

- **Critical Services:** WantlistSyncService (online/offline sync logic, merge conflicts, API error handling)
- **API Integration:** DiscogsService (OAuth authentication, API response parsing, rate limiting)
- **Data Layer:** JsonService, ConfigManager, ImportExportService
- **UI Components:** AlbumFormWidget, AlbumListWidget, SearchBarWidget
- **Complete Flows:** Add ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Delete album workflows with form validation

The test coverage ensures robust functionality across all core features of the application.

## Motivation

The idea for **MusicUp** came from my personal need to organize a large collection of CDs and vinyl records. Initially,
I used a paid app that allowed scanning albums, but it often failed to find certain CDs, requiring manual entries. As a
result, I decided to build **MusicUp**, focusing on ease of use and customization. Scanning is a feature I may consider
adding in the future, but for now, manual input is still a reliable option.

**MusicUp** is currently available and tested on:
- **Linux Desktop** (specifically tested on Linux Mint)
- **Android** (mobile version available)

## Contributing

**MusicUp** is currently developed as a personal project. While the source code is publicly visible for educational purposes, the project is not accepting external contributions at this time. 

If you have suggestions or feedback, please feel free to contact the author directly.

## Project Background

I also have a repository with a Swift version of this software, which I originally developed on Swift/IOS. My initial
thought was, "Great! Just one codebase, and I can publish on all platforms." However, I quickly ran into dependency
issues that became difficult to resolve.

As a result, I developed the mobile version of the software for my iPhone in Swift.

### Future Plans

1. **iOS Version** - Flutter version for iPhone and iPad
2. **Windows & macOS Desktop** - Native Flutter desktop applications
3. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Advanced statistics and analytics (listening habits, collection insights)
   - Cloud synchronization options for multi-device access
   - Barcode scanning for quick album identification
   - Enhanced offline capabilities
